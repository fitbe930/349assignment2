# COSC349 Assignment2
This repo contains the files for a Student signup webapp. If you want to create this yourself first you need an aws account and make your own ec2 instances (one for the webapp and another for admin access).

Once the EC2 instances are running run the command: ~ 
sudo yum install httpd php php-mysql mysql-server
~

Then in the web-server ec2 move into the /var/www/http/ directory and add the following files: index.html, process_form.php, backup.sh
and for admin access ec2 move into the /var/www/http/ directory and add the following files: admin_login.html, admin_panel.php, delete_student.php

You will need to create your own Amazon RDS instance running MySQL. Test you can connect to the RDS from your EC2 by running this command: ~
mysql â€“h "your_SQL_endpoint" -u "your_DB_username" -p
~
and then entering you database password. When you can connect to the database, change this block of code:

~
$dbhost = 'db.cgmjlbiqninb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com';
$dbuser = "user";
$dbpass = "password";
$dbname = "studs";

$conn = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname);
~

to your own database credentials.
use db_setup.sql to create the structure of the database.

if you want to add scheduling to the backup.sh file, you will need to install cronie(sudo yum install -y cronie).
